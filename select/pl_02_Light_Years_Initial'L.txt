You were waiting outside for me
in the sun
Lying down to soak it all in
before we had to run
I was always ten feet behind
you from the start
Didn’t know you were gone till
we were in the car
Oh the glory of it all was
lost on me
Till I saw how hard it’d be
to reach you
And I would always be
Light years
Light years away from you
Light years
Light years away from you
I thought I saw your mother
last weekend in the park
It could been anybody, it was
after dark
Everyone was lightning up
in the shadows alone
You coulda been right there
next to me and I’d have
never know
Oh the glory of it all was
lost on me
Till I saw how hard it’d be
to reach you
And I would always be
Light years
Light years away from you
Light years
Light years away from you
Light years
Light years away from you
Light years
Light years away from you
