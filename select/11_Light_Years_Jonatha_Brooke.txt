We said "I love you" so easily
Like honey on our daily bread
"Give us this day," you would always say
The rest was better left unsaid

But now, you're calling my name
You sing your melancholy refrain
You give me wings when I have no strength remaining
Though you're light years away
Light years away, light years...

In a blue folder addressed to me
You left your final testament
All the despair and complicity
You finally said the things you really meant

Now, you're calling my name
You sing your melancholy refrain
You give me wings when I have no strength remaining
Though you're light years away
Light years away...

Hold me tight, hold me, don't let go
Tell me everything is blue skies
Suddenly, I don't, can't see what's real
I'm day blind, but I'm night wise

Now, I'm calling your name
I sing your melancholy refrain
I'll spread my wings for all of my days remaining
Though you're light years away,
Light years away, light years away.
