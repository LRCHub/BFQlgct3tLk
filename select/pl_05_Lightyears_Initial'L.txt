Sitting on top of the world
Trying to figure it out
Trying everything new
for the first time
Testing your patience
by running my mouth
I thoughtI knew more than
I do now
He said I, I was you yesterday
Take your time don't give it
all away
Start living life in the moment
Your eyes are barely open
then it's gone
When you're playing life
by the numbers
Try run away the faster it comes
It's not lightyears away
It's not lightyears away
It isn't lightyears away
You'll never be told
No you'll never listen
Until you've been walking
in these shoes
You're just growing older,
but don't overthink it
Wear your mistakes
like an armour
He said I, I was there yesterday
Take your time,
don't give it all away
Start living life in the moment
Your eyes are barely open
then it's gone
When you're playing life
by the numbers
Try run away the faster it comes
It's not lightyears away
It isn't lightyears away
Yeah, it's not lightyears away
It isn't lightyears away
Time don't wait for no one
(You'll be older
when the morning comes 'round)
Time don't wait for no one
(And you'll feel like
it's a real long time)
You'll feel like
it's a real long time
Start living life in the moment
Your eyes are barely open
then it's gone
When you're playing life
by the numbers
Try run away the faster it comes
It's not lightyears away
It's not lightyears away
It isn't lightyears away
It's not lightyears away
