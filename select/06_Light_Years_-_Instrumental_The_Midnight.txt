I fell in love with the feeling
Didn't fall in love with you
There was a song I was singing
It wasn't meant for you

I am sorry
That I can't stay
And I am sorry
We're light years away

I bite your lip
And you taste like summer time
I can't forget
The days when you were mine

Do you wander the streets every night
Just to find me too?

Light years
Echoes
In the streetlights
In between those
Spaces in the moment
Come and find me
Where we let go
Come and find me
Where we let go

I fell in love with a feeling
And your funny faces
You were beautiful and broken
In all the right places

I am sorry
That I can't stay
And I am sorry
We're light years away

Millions behind or light years ahead
Our time is now, our time was then
And I hear your voice inside of my head
But it's just a silhouette

Do you wonder what happens
To all of the love we lose?

Light years
Echoes
In the streetlights
In between those
Spaces in the moment
Come and find me
Where we let go
Come and find me
Where we let go
Come and find me
Where we let go

Light years
Do you want your tears back?
Light years
They're gone
I'm sorry

Light years
Echoes
In the streetlights
In between those
Spaces in the moment
Come and find me
Where we let go

Light years
Echoes
In the streetlights
In between those
Spaces in the moment
Come and find me
Where we let go

Light years
(Come and find me)
(Where we let go)
Do you want your tears back?
(Come and find me)
(Where we let go)

Light years
(Come and find me)
(Where we let go)
They're gone
I'm sorry
(Come and find me)
(Where we let go)
